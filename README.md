An alarm will remind us when each of the time id off, we can click the "DISMISS ALARM" button to turn off the sound.

## 技術
This is a pure front-end project developed by using React Hook; The state control like useState, useEffect in react hook helps me a lot on data manipulation

The "Top" part of the whole project is an exercise of Html/Css technic

Also, I was interested in one of the presentations in mid-term, so I decided to use "Material UI" to beautify my project layout. For example, the side bar and all the buttons elements are from material UI.

The "audio" tag in html helps me dealing with the alarm sounds  

I use "react-scroll" project to make the redirect operation smoother
